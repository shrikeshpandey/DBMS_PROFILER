# DBMS_PROFILER
DBMS Profiler
PL/SQL developers are always trying to optimize their code to perform more efficiently.  As of Oracle 8.1.5, a utility exists that assists developers with this process, dbms_profiler, one of the most under-utilized utilities within Oracle.   

The basic idea behind profiling is for the developer to understand where their code is spending the most time, so they can detect and optimize it.  The profiling utility allows Oracle to collect data in memory structures and then dumps it into tables as application code is executed.  dbms_profiler is to PL/SQL, what tkprof and Explain Plan are to SQL
